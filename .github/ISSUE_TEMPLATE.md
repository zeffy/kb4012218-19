Before you create an issue, make sure it has not already been reported.

Then, make sure the following things are included in your issue:

- wufuc version (can be viewed in Add & Remove Programs).
- Operating system version and Service Pack (including 32- or 64-bit).
- Short description of the issue.
- Elaborate steps to reproduce the bug/issue being reported.
- Attach wufuc's log file (located at `C:\ProgramData\wufuc\wufuc.log`).
- Any supporting information that could help solve/understand the issue.

Any issues that do not include these, or go more than a week without a
response from the original poster will be subject to closure at my discretion.

If you have questions, be sure to check here:

It is common for issues to go unanswered for several days or even weeks,
so please do not take offense at this. 

I read every issue and usually only reply if there is clarification needed,
or if there is a new release pending that will solve the issue.
