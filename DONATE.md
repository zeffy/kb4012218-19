# Help support the development of wufuc

Thanks for showing an interest in donating!

While any support is very highly appreciated, please keep in mind that donations should be considered gifts for my past efforts towards this project, and not made with the assumption of continued support. All donations go to the project maintainer, [**@zeffy**](https://github.com/zeffy).

## Donate Bitcoin

- [**Donate Bitcoin on Mycelium Gear**](https://admin.gear.mycelium.com/gateways/3554/orders/new)

## Other donation options

Currently I'm only accepting Bitcoin, but I'm open to adding other ways of donating. 
If you know of a good donation platform, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc/issues/new) and I will look into it.
