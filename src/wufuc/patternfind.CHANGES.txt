Changes made:

- Ported to C, removed dependency on C++ type vector<T>.
- Uses stdint.h type uint8_t instead of unsigned char (for readability).
- Renamed patternfind overloads to patternfind, patternfind_bytes, patternfind_pbyte.
- Added VirtualProtect to patternwrite function to prevent access violation exceptions.
- Added FlushInstructionCache to patternwrite function.
