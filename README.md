Disables the "Unsupported Hardware" message in Windows Update, and allows you to continue installing updates on Windows 7 and 8.1 systems with Intel Kaby Lake, AMD Ryzen, or other unsupported processors.

## Downloads 

**[Latest stable build][Latest] - Most people will want this version.**

## Preface

The release notes for Windows updates KB4012218 and KB4012219 included the following:

> Enabled detection of processor generation and hardware support when PC tries to scan or download updates through Windows Update.

These updates marked the implementation of a [policy change](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/01/15/windows-10-embracing-silicon-innovation/) they announced some time ago, where Microsoft stated that they would not be supporting Windows 7 or 8.1 on next-gen Intel, AMD and Qualcomm processors.
This was essentially a big middle finger to anyone who decides to not "upgrade" to the steaming pile of :shit: known as Windows 10, especially considering the extended support periods for Windows 7 and 8.1 won't be ending until January 4, 2020 and January 10, 2023 respectively.

## Some people with older Intel and AMD processors are also affected!

I've received user reports of the following CPUs all being blocked from receiving updates:

- [Intel Atom Z530](https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc/issues/7)
- [Intel Atom D525](https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc/issues/34)
- [Intel Core i5-M 560](https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc/issues/23)
- [Intel Core i5-4300M](https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc/issues/24)
- [Intel Pentium B940](https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc/issues/63)
- [AMD FX-8350](https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc/issues/32)
- [AMD Turion 64 Mobile Technology ML-34](https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc/issues/80)

## Bad Microsoft!

If you are interested, you can read my original write up on discovering the CPU check [here](https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc/tree/old-kb4012218-19).

## Features

- Enables Windows Update on PCs with unsupported processors.
- Written in C, the best programming language. :sunglasses:
- Completely free (as in freedom) software.
- Does not modify any system files.
- Byte pattern-based patching, which means it will usually keep working even after new updates come out.
- No dependencies.

## How it works

Basically, inside a system file called `wuaueng.dll` there are two functions responsible for the CPU check: `IsDeviceServiceable(void)` and `IsCPUSupported(void)`. 
`IsDeviceServiceable` simply calls `IsCPUSupported` once, and then re-uses the result that it receives on subsequent calls.
My patch takes advantage of this behavior by patching a couple of boolean values and basically making Windows Update think that it has already checked your processor, and the result was that it is indeed supported.

- The installer registers a scheduled task that automatically starts wufuc on system boot/user log on.
- Depending on how the Windows Update service is configured to run, wufuc will:
    * **Shared process**: inject itself into the service host process that Windows Update will run in when it starts.
    * **Own process**: wait for the Windows Update service to start and then inject into it.
- After that, wufuc will install some API hooks when appropriate:
    * `LoadLibraryExW` hook will automatically hook the `IsDeviceServiceable()` function inside `wuaueng.dll` when it is loaded.
    * `RegQueryValueExW` hook is necessary to provide compatibility with [UpdatePack7R2](../../issues/100). This hook not applied when `wuauserv` is configured to run in its own process.

## FAQ

### How to deploy wufuc using Group Policy

[There is a tutorial on the Advanced Installer website that explains how to do this](http://www.advancedinstaller.com/user-guide/tutorial-gpo.html).

### How to use unattended feature in the batch setup scripts

`install_wufuc.bat` and `uninstall_wufuc.bat` both support two command line parameters that can be used alone, or combined to change the behavior of the scripts:

- `/NORESTART` - Automatically declines rebooting after the setup finishes.
- `/UNATTENDED` - Skips all prompts for user interaction, and automatically restarts unless `/NORESTART` is also specified.

These must be used from an elevated command line prompt.

### How to manually remove wufuc v0.8.0.x when it is impossible to uninstall it normally

This only applies to wufuc version 0.8.0.x, which was only available for download for a short period of time. Other versions are unaffected. 

There was a fundamental issue with the method I tried using in this version that caused very serious system instability, such as User Account Control breaking, getting a black screen with just a cursor at boot or after logging out, or very slow overall system performance from multiple services crashing repeatedly which would eventually end in a blue screen of death. Many of these issues unfortunately made uninstalling wufuc nearly impossible. I apologize for any inconvenience this version of wufuc may have caused.

#### To manually uninstall wufuc v0.8.0.x:

1. [Boot into Safe Mode with Command Prompt](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode).
2. In the command prompt type `regedit` and press enter.
3. Navigate to the key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options`
4. Expand the `Image File Execution Options` tree.
5. Locate the `svchost.exe` sub key, right-click it and press **Delete**.
6. Reboot, and you should be able to log in normally again.
7. Open Add and Remove Programs, locate and run the normal wufuc uninstaller to complete the removal process.
